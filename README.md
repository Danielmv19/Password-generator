# Password Generator

## Description
This Python script generates secure random passwords based on user input. It allows users to specify the length of the password (between 6 and 22 characters) and choose between generating a single password or multiple (five) passwords. The passwords include a mix of digits, lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and special symbols for enhanced security.

The script uses the `questionary` library for an interactive command-line interface, `rich` for formatted console output, and Python's built-in `random`, `time`, and `string` modules for password generation.

## Code Structure
- `pass_generator(longitud)`: Generates a random password of specified length using digits, lowercase, uppercase, and special symbols.
- `long_validator(_)`: Validates that the password length is between 6 and 22.
- `long_q()`: Prompts the user for password length with validation.
- `run()`: Handles the main logic for generating one or five passwords based on user input.
- Main loop: Allows users to generate more passwords until they choose to exit.
